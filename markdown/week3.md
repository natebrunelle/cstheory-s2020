# Week 3: Counting Past Infinity

This week, our main goals are:

- Discuss some similarities and differences between the theory and practice of computing.
- Have you mind blown by infinities.
- See and example of the limits of computing.

# Reading

[TCS Chapter 2](https://introtcs.org/public/lec_02_representation.html) for our discussions on what can and cannot be represented by binary strings.

Here are some things that may be of interest to you:

- A [pdf of Cantor's proof](/files/cantors_proof.pdf) as described by Nathan Brunelle in lecture.
- Cantor's original proof (in German, but the math is universal, so somewhat understandable even without knowing German): Georg Cantor, [_Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre_](/docs/cantor-proof.pdf). Published in _Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung_, Volume 1, 1891. ([About this Scan](https://jeffersonswheel.org/cantors-no-longer-lost-proof/))

# Cohort Problems

These are the problems you should discuss and solve first independently, then with your cohort (supposing you're in one). These problems focus on material discussed in the February 7 and February 9 lectures.

[PS2 [PDF]](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/s2022/files/ps/ps2_blank.pdf)


## Submission Instructions

1. Download the [PS2 template](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/s2022/files/ps/ps2.zip)
1. In Overleaf, click on *Create First Project* or *New Project in Overleaf* and select *Upload Project* from the menu.
1. Click *Select a .zip file* then select the *ps2.zip* you downloaded in step 1
1. Look in `ps2.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with either (if you're working alone) your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`) or (if you're working in a cohort) your cohort name (e.g. `submitter{Cohort Lamport}`)
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `ps2.pdf`.
1. Upload your pdf to [kytos](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory) to submit.


# Optional Videos

These are relevant videos from previous semesters. You may find them helpful, but you are not require or expected to watch them. Please be aware that the Spring 2021 semester was much shorter than the Spring 2022 semester, giving us the ability to move a bit slower and cover more depth this semester.
