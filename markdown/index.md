title: Theory of Computation
...

# Course Overview 

This is a course on the theoretical aspects of computer science. This semester we will define and study computing from a theoretical perspective. Your experience will provide an understanding of:

- Formal definitions of computing and computers
- What "problems" can and cannot be computed according to those definitions (*computability*)
- Formal definitons of computational efficiency
- What "problems" can and cannot be computed efficiently according to those definitions (*complexity*)
- How theoretical formalisms inspire and are inspired by the practice of computer science.

## Course Objectives

Students who complete this course will be able to:


- Write convincing arguments using formal definitions and mathematical reasoning.
- Reason about the differences between finite and infinite models of computation and what they can and cannot compute.
- Express intuitively and formally what makes some problems too expensive to solve, and what can be done in practice when an unsolvable or intractable problem is encountered.
- Reason formally about the cost of computation, and be able to prove useful bounds on the costs of solving problems, including showing that certain problems are intractable.


## Eligibility
