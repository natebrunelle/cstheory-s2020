title: Course Structure
...


This course is structured in a way to enable and encourage collaborative learning. We have found that students are well-served by learning theoretical material (as is covered in this course) within welcoming and comfortable learning communities. For this reason, this course makes groupwork a major focus by recommending and enabling students to work in cohorts throughout the semester.

# Tasks

There are 4 categories of tasks students will complete throughout the semester:

- **Problem Sets**: Consist of 4-7 problems to be solved collaboratively and submitted collectively by cohorts. Expect to have one problem set per week, with deadlines typically occurring on Mondays.
- **Quizzes**: Consist of 1-3 problems to be completed individually. Students may use their own notes or course materials for quizzes. Expect to have a quiz roughly every other week, with deadlines occurring on Fridays. Note that the last quiz (Quiz6) is due during the final exam period
- **Optional Quiz Re-attempt**: In lieue of a final exam, students may opt re-attempt up to two quizzes from the semester. If these quizzes are submitted then they will replace your original grade on the corresponding quiz, whether that increases or decreases your grade.

# Cohorts

Students in the class are strongly encouraged to form cohorts, small groups
of at most 6 students, who we hope will form effective learning
sub-communities. Each cohort will be expected to work as a group to
help all members succeed, and each individual will be expected to
contribute to their own success as well as the success of the other
members of their cohort.

Cohorts are to work collaboratively on all Problem Sets in this course and submit one set of solutions to represent all the members of the cohort. 

For your cohort to be most effective for learning, we recommend that cohorts gather at least once a week for a preparation meeting. At the end of a successful cohort preparation meeting, every student in the cohort should understand all the main ideas from the course materials for that week, and be able to solve and discuss the assigned problems. To maximize chances of success for students, we recommend that their preparation meetings happen 2-4 days prior to each problem set deadline. Most problem sets will be due on Mondays, so we suggest preparation meetings occur between Thursday and Saturday (though meeting early on Sunday may be nearly as effective).

For each problem set, students will be expected to do the following:


- **Before each preparation meeting**: Each individual student attempts all problem set problems, seeking help from the course staff or cohort-mates as needed
- **During each preparation meeting**: Students present their (potentially incomplete) solutions and questions/confusions to their group members. The cohort then converges on the best answers they ccan muster for each problem
- **Before each problem set deadline**: Students draft and review their agreed-upon solutions to the problems. Students seek additional help from the course staff as necessary.


## Cohort Creation

Students may either select their own cohorts or may be assigned to cohorts based on the information provided in the beginning-of-course survey. Cohort assignments will be done around students' provided scheduling constraints. We encourage cohorts to be as close to 6 students as possible. If you have people in mind whom you'd like to work with, but there are fewer than 6 of you, then we suggest you try to fill your group by recruiting more members in discord.

While participation in cohorts is strongly encouraged, students may work independently throughout the semester (though those students must complete the same problem sets).

# Sample Weekly Schedule

A sample weekly schedule for students in the course is below (this schedule supposes your preparation meeting will occur on Fridays, cohorts meeting at different times will need to adjust this schedule accordingly):

Day             Activity                                  Estimated Time
--------------- ----------------------------------------- ---------
Monday          Attend Lecture                            75 minutes
                Submit last week's problem set            15 minutes
Tuesday         Preparation Materials (Readings)          60 minutes
Wednesday       Attend Lecture                            75 minutes
                Preparation Materials (Readings)          60 minutes
Thursday        Work on Problem Set (individually)        120 minutes
Friday          Preparation Meeting (with cohort)         75 minutes
Saturday/Sunday Finish and Draft solutions                120 minutes
Total Time                                                10 hrs/week

The schedule is designed to expect 10 hours of total work per week,
commensurate with guidelines for a 3-unit course, and we hope this will work best
for most students by spreading the work throughout the week following
a schedule similar to the one above.

Although we have sequentialized the preparation and problem working
efforts, we expect for most students these will be done more
fluidly. It may be valuable to read through the assigned problems at
the beginning of the week and then attempt to solve problems as you
complete the relevant preparation materials, rather than waiting until after all relevant lectures before approaching the problems.




# Communication Platforms

We will primarily use Discord course announcements and interactive communication. The course web page will be used for course content. Collab will be only sparsely used by this course.

**Course Website:** This is the course website. We will post all instructional materials and logistical information here. 
  
**Kytos Submission System:** We will also
  use a [custom-built Kytos site](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory/) for assignment
  submissions and grading.

**Discord:** We will use the course discord server for most other
  course communications (you will receive information on joining the
  server by email). We expect students to receive messages we send to
  the `#announcements` channel as well as any direct messages we send to you
  on discord. Each cohort will have a channel on the Discord server.
  

If you have questions about course materials or assignments that will
be relevant to other students, please ask them either in the `#general` channel 
or else in the channel associated with the relevant task type (e.g. `#problemsets`). This will get the fastest response, since all of the course
staff and students will see your question and be able to respond
to it. If you have questions of a personal nature that you only want
to make to the instructor, please use the course discord to contact Professor Brunelle (`@nateb`) in a Direct Message instead of
emailing independently.

**Collab:** Collab will contain links to the above platforms as well as links to zoom live lecture streams and zoom recordings of previous lectures (under the ``Online Meetings'' tool)

**Email:** Managing email for a large class like this is difficult,
  and we prefer to use the course discord for most communications
  relevant to the class. You should feel free to use email for
  messages peripherally related to the course (e.g., emailing an
  instructor about interest in their research). You should also use
  email if you post a question on discord but don't receive an adequate
  response within 24 hours.
