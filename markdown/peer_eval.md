title: Peer Evaluation
...



# Purpose

Your final peer evaluation is to occur after your week 12 assessed meeting and before end-of-day on Friday May 7. You will evaluate all cohort-members (including yourself) on 5 items. Each item will have 4 options: exceeds expectations, meets expectations, room for improvement, unsatisfactory. The chart describes example behaviors to merit each category. Select the best fit.

Unlike with previous weeks, responses will not be shared with your cohortmates. They will be seen only by the course staff.
