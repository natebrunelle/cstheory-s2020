# Week 2: Proof Techniques and bit strings

This week, our main goals are:

- Review discrete math baground, in particular proof techniques.
- Discuss how we can represent things with binary strings, in particular binary representations of natural numbers.
- Learn how to use functions to reason about the sizes of sets.

# Reading

Material in this week's lectures parallels with [TCS Chapter 2](https://introtcs.org/public/lec_02_representation.html) which discusses what can and cannot be represented by binary strings. Some material in that chapter will not be addressed until next week.

# Cohort Problems

These are the problems you should discuss and solve first independently, then with your cohort (supposing you're in one). These problems focus on material discussed in the January 31 and February 2 lectures.

## Submission Instructions

1. Download the [PS1 template](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/s2022/files/ps/ps1.zip)
1. In Overleaf, click on *Create First Project* or *New Project in Overleaf* and select *Upload Project* from the menu.
1. Click *Select a .zip file* then select the *ps0.zip* you downloaded in step 1
1. Look in `ps1.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with either (if you're working alone) your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`) or (if you're working in a cohort) your cohort name (e.g. `submitter{Cohort Lamport}`)
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `ps1.pdf`.
1. Upload your pdf to [kytos](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory) to submit.


# Optional Videos

These are relevant videos from previous semesters. You may find them helpful, but you are not require or expected to watch them. Please be aware that the Spring 2021 semester was much shorter than the Spring 2022 semester, giving us the ability to move a bit slower this semester. As such, about half of the material covered during week 2 in Spring 2021 will not be covered until week 3 for Spring 2022.
