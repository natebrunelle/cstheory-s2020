title: Quiz 4 | NFAs and TMs
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to create NFAs for a few languages
1. One asking you to evaluate the ``running time'' (i.e. number of transitions taken) of a few strings on a provided Turing machine.
1. One asking you to describe how to compute some functions using Turing machines (that is, Turing machine pseudo-code)

This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 8](/week8.html) and [week 9](/week9.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 7 and 8. No material introduced after week 9 will be represented in this quiz.

I will provide sample solutions for problem sets 7 and 8 to help you out, but I need to wait until those with extensions have opportunity to submit. They will be posted by end of day Thursday.

1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
