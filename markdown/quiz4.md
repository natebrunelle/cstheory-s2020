title: Quiz 4 | NFAs and TMs
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to create NFAs for a few languages
1. One asking you to evaluate the ``running time'' (i.e. number of transitions taken) of a few strings on a provided Turing machine.
1. One asking you to describe how to compute some functions using Turing machines (that is, Turing machine pseudo-code)

This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 8](/week8.html) and [week 9](/week9.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 7 and 8. No material introduced after week 9 will be represented in this quiz.

To help you prepare, I have provided sample solutions for [Problem Set 7](/files/ps/ps7_solutions.pdf) and [Problem Set 8](/files/ps/ps8_solutions.pdf).

1. Look in `quiz3.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with  your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`).
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `quiz4.pdf`.
1. Upload your pdf to [kytos](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory) to submit.
