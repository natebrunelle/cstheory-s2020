The University will be conducting exclusively online through at least April 5 (there will be a reassessment at some point prior to that date). The course will be modified in the following ways.

# LecturesÂ 

I hope to do live lectures [via zoom](https://virginia.zoom.us/j/134834401) during our normal class time (3:30pm Tuesday/Thurday). I will record these meetings and link to them on the [schedule page](/schedule.html) after they're finished (i.e., where lecture recordings currently appear). Please [create a zoom account](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=65496792dbce6384a6ddc19115961912) and practice joining/hosting meetings with your friends. Please note that live lectures may prove to be problematic, and if that's not going smoothly then I will post pre-recorded lectures.


# Exercises/quizzes

Since all assignments have always been released/returned/graded online, the procedure for that will remain unchanged.


# Office Hours: 

Brunelle's office hours will be conducted [via zoom](https://virginia.zoom.us/j/2191769718). Simply drop into the meeting for those. 

TA office hours will be held differently. There is a new [Office Hours queue](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/ohq/?c=cs3102) tool on the course webpage. To get help during scheduled office hours, you will add yourself to the queue with a link to your personal zoom meeting room. Please just hang out in that meeting room until it's your turn, a TA will join you. If you are working with a group, feel free to have your group members in that room with you.


# Exams: 

Midterm 2 has been moved to April 7. This is after the reevaluation of the in-person hiatus. If we are regathering in Charlottesville on April 5, we will conduct the midterm as planned. Otherwise, you will be notified of the plan.
