## Meetings

We will meet as a whole class just once during the semester. This will occur on the first day of class: Tuesday February 2, 3:30pm on [Zoom](TODO).

For the remainder of the semester, you will be expected to meet twice weekly with your cohorts at the times designated when your cohort is assigned.

For all course-related communications, [Discord](TODO) is preferred to email.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them for help on course content outside of the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

We will primarily use the free online textbook *Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science* by Boaz Barak. Please first refer to the [copy availble on our page](/files/tcs_book.pdf).
We will refer to the textbook as "TCS" when listing readings.

This is a new textbook that is freely available from [introtcs.org](https://introtcs.org) under a Creative Commons license.
In addition to costing $271.95 less than the traditional textbook for this class, this book takes a modern
and innovative approach to introducing theory of computation which has several advantages (and a
few disadvantages) of the traditional approach (which we will discuss some in class, and be happy to
elaborate on during office hours). We plan to follow the organization and material in the textbook fairly
closely, but will also cover some topics that are not included, and present some of the material in ways
that are different from how it is presented in the book.
Although the book is available free to read on-line, we do recommend printing out the chapters you
are reading from the PDF files. Numerous studies have found that essentially everyone reads faster and comprehends better from printed paper than from even the best on-screen reading. To encourage
on-paper reading, we will provide links on the course website to PDF files for relevant chapters.
In addition to the course textbook, some readings will be assigned from other (freely available) sources.

This textbook is still in development, and Nathan Brunelle is in frequent communication with the author on improvements. If you find any errors in the textbook, feel free to submit an issue in the [book github](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues). Doing so will earn extra credit (with factual errors being worth more than typographical errors).

## Lectures


Due to Covid-19, we will only have one in-person lecture this semester, which will occur on February 2 (i.e. the first day of class). For the remainder of the semester, we will be providing recorded videos. These will be some mix of footage from previously recorded lectures, original content, and relevant (and sometimes irrelevant) third party content.


## Tasks {#tasks}

Each week, Students will be expected to do the following:

- **Before their first cohort meeting**: Watch provided instructional videos, read provided instructional text, attempt weekly problem sets, attend office hours to improve understanding when necessary
- **During their first cohort meeting**: Discuss (potentially incomplete or incorrect) solutions with the cohort. Collaborate and converge on the best answer you can muster for each problem.
- **Between their cohort meetings**: Review solutions from the first weekly cohort meeting to ensure you understand them. Seek clarification from your cohort-mates or office hours when necessary. Refine solutions if necessary.
- **During their second cohort meeting**: Do your best to provide solutions when called-upon by the TA. The TA will ask each student to attempt at least one problem, and may ask follow-up or clarification questions to more accurately assess understanding.
- **After their second cohort meeting**: Complete and submit your problem writeup.


**Exams**: There will be no traditional exams in this course

# Grading


We hope that you can spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade. That said, we understand students are often
stressed about grading and understandably want to know where they
stand in a class without having to rely just on the judgment of the
course staff.  We aim to grade in a way that is useful (provides
students with accurate measure of how well they understood what they
should), motivating (encourages the behaviors we prefer, including
hard but not obsessive work), fair (assigned higher grades to more
deserving students), robust (arbitrary small perturbations do not have
a material impact on someone's grade), and low stress (for both
students and the course staff).


To this end, your grade will be determined by 3 components (in order of weight):

- **Assessed Cohort Meetings**: TAs will provide a score after each assessed cohort meeting to reflect how well you understood content from that week.
- **Writeups**: In order to ensure you are able to communicate ideas in writing, each week you will be asked to write up one problem (as assigned during your Assessed Cohort Meeting).
- **Community**: At the end of the semester there will be a qualitative assessment of how effectively your cohort operated as an educational sub-community, and how well you contributed to the cohort. This will be derived from evaluations submitted by your peers and by your Cohort Coach (TA).

## Assessed Cohort Meetings

The main assessment will be based on students
performance in the weekly cohort meetings.  Each student will be
evaluated based on how well they are able to present problems at these
meetings. It is not necessary or expected that students can solve
every problem or have a complete solution, and the cohort meetings are
meant more for learning than assessment, but it is expected that every
student in the cohort is prepared to discuss every problem in the
assigned problem set.

Students will be assigned a grade based on their performance at the
cohort meeting on this scale (fractional grades are possible):

Grade Meaning
----- -------
3     Able to present on the selected problem well and to demonstrate good understanding of key concepts.
2     Able to demonstrate some understanding of key concepts and preparation effort, but not able to make progress on the selected problem.
1     Showed some understanding of the concepts needed to solve the selected problem, but not well prepared or able to make steps towards a reasonable solution.
0     Not able to contribute to the cohort meeting.

### Absences

We will make allowances for cases where a student is not able to make
a scheduled cohort meeting due to extenuating circumstances and
provide a way for students to request an exemption due to a valid
reason for being unable to make a cohort meeting. Otherwise, a student
who misses a cohort meeting received 0 cohort assessment points for
that week. We consider medical issues, personal trauma, legal
obligations, family responsibilities, and other justifiable conflicts
to be valid reasons for missing cohort meetings, and students who are
not able to make a scheduled cohort meeting for such reasons will not
be disadvantaged as a result. In cases where a student has to miss
more than two cohort meetings during the semester, we will provide an
alternate assessment through an individual video meeting.

When possible, the exemption request should be submitted 48 hours before the assessed cohort meeting.

## Writeups

Each week your cohort coach will assign a problem from the weekly problem set to writeup. Each student will writeup this problem individually. You may reference notes your and your cohort-mates compiled prior to the assessed cohort meeting, but you may not collaborate on the writeup after the assessed meeting has occurred.

Students will be assigned a grade based on the quality of their writeup according to this scale (fractional grades are possible:

Grade Meaning
----- -------
2     Writeup correctly solves the problem with a clearly-presented description.
1.5   Writeup is nearly complete, but may have minor misconceptions.
1     Writeup is correct except for major misconceptions.
0.5   Writeup conveys some understanding of relevant concepts, but little progress is made towards a complete solution.
0     Writeup has little similarity to a complete and correct solution.


## Individual Grades

We will have 12 assessed cohort meetings during the semester (with 60
total points available for full credit, and some opportunities for
bonus points). The individual grade for students will be based on this
scale:

Individual Grade Cohort+Writeup Points
---------------- ---------------------
A                48
B                40
C                32

With the exception of cases of academic dishonesty or inappropriate
behavior, we guarantee that you will at least receive the minimum
letter grade given in the table (possibly modified by a <b>-</b> based
on the community grading described below), but you may be assigned a
higher grade based on your overall performance and showing improvement
over the course of the semester.

In cases where a student's grade is not clear based on their cohort
assessments, we will provide option for students to request an oral
final exam to be scheduled with one of the instructors during the exam
period.

## Community Grades

In addition to the individual cohort assessment
  grades, each cohort will receive a community grade based on how well
  the cohort does as a group.

Two main factors will contribute to a cohort's community grade:

- Overall performance of the cohort during assessed cohort
  meetings. Doing well on this depends on all members of the cohort
  being prepared to present problems well. This will be determined
  based on the sum of the individual cohort assessments, the weekly
  individual minimum individual cohort assessment, and the trend of
  these values over the semester.

- The quality of the cohort's written problem submissions. The cohort
  will submit the problem write-up as a group, and everyone in the
  cohort receives the same grade.

The community grade typically will impact individual final grades by
either a <b>+</b> or a <b>-</b> added to the individual letter grade
(resulting from the individual grading above).

In most cases, the community grade will apply equally to all members
of the cohort. In unusual cases where it is clear that one member of a
cohort is not contributing, or there are reasons why a cohort is not
succeeding that are beyond the responsiblity of individual students in
that cohort, appropriate adjustments will be made. 


# Miscellanea

## Pledge

All students of CS3102 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.

## Honesty

I always hope everyone will behave honestly.
I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

**Quizzes**: You must complete quizzes entirely on your own, do not discuss the contents of a quiz with anyone outside the course staff prior to its deadline. You may use only officially-provided or personally-created materials when completing at-home quizzes. This means you may only use:

- The course textbook
- Anything on the course webpage or linked to from the course webpage
- Your personal notes (or those of a note-taker if you receive them as accommodation)
- Lecture recordings

**Exercises**: You may collaborate with up to 2 other people (i.e. a group of up to 3 total) when completing exercises. You may additionally use external materials with following restrictions:

- Your write-ups must be done entirely independently. You may take notes while meeting with your collaborators, but we expect that the answers you submit be expressed in your own words. 
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with David Evans on the pdf style, I consulted \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Aligning\%20equations\%20with\%20amsmath} for help with the align environment, Robbie Hott helped me to debug the for loop on line 107 of my code."

**Exams**: You are permitted a printed-out 1 page (front and back) reference sheet for the exam. You may put anything you would like on this reference sheet. You are not permitted to use any other resources on the exam. This means that the following non-exhaustive list of items is not permitted:

- Laptops
- Cell Phones
- Neighbors
- Textbooks
- Smart watches


### Consequences of Dishonesty

If I believe you have acted dishonestly, I will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information I lack, please share that with me; I may thereafter change my belief and/or proposed penalty.


## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

### Religious observances

 It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
