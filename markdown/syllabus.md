## Meetings

Lectures are held in Maury 209 5:00pm-6:15pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. All lectures will additionally be live-streamed via Zoom (links to the meetings are available in collab under "Online Meetings"). The live streams will also be recorded for later viewing (links available in collab "Online Meetings"). There may be supplementary instructional videos posted, those will be available on the [schedule page](/schedule.html).

For all course-related communications, Discord is preferred to email.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them for help on course content outside of the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

We will primarily use the free online textbook *Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science* by Boaz Barak. Please first refer to the [copy availble on our page](/files/tcs_book.pdf).
We will refer to the textbook as "TCS" when listing readings.

This is a new textbook that is freely available from [introtcs.org](https://introtcs.org) under a Creative Commons license.
In addition to costing $271.95 less than the traditional textbook for this class, this book takes a modern
and innovative approach to introducing theory of computation which has several advantages (and a
few disadvantages) of the traditional approach (which we will discuss some in class, and be happy to
elaborate on during office hours). We plan to follow the organization and material in the textbook fairly
closely, but will also cover some topics that are not included, and present some of the material in ways
that are different from how it is presented in the book.
Although the book is available free to read on-line, we do recommend printing out the chapters you
are reading from the PDF files. Numerous studies have found that essentially everyone reads faster and comprehends better from printed paper than from even the best on-screen reading. To encourage
on-paper reading, we will provide links on the course website to PDF files for relevant chapters.
In addition to the course textbook, some readings will be assigned from other (freely available) sources.

This textbook is still in development, and Nathan Brunelle is in frequent communication with the author on improvements. If you find any errors in the textbook, feel free to submit an issue in the [book github](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues). Doing so will earn extra credit (with factual errors being worth more than typographical errors).


# Grading

In February 2019 the CS faculty approved [a definition](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu/grading-guidelines.html) of what we believe grades mean.
It is my intent to approximate that definition in this course.
As a brief summary,

Letter  Student demonstrated                Recommendation re future courses[^future]
------  ---------------------------         ------------------------------------
A       mastery of all topics               likely to do well
B       competence in significant topics    able to do well with some review
C       sufficient competence               likely to be challenging
D       minimal competence                  unlikely to succeed
F       less than minimal competence        retake this course first

[^future]:
    While there are no regularly-offerred UVA undergraduate courses which list cs3102 as a prerequisite, this recommendation will be mostly relative to a hypothetical follow-on course.

We will consider the grade assigned by the following point-based breakdown to be a **guideline** for the grade earned according to the definitions above.

Task                        Weight  Comments
-------------------------  -------- ----------------------------------------------
Quizzes                     50%     6 total at 8.33% each
Problem Sets                50%     13 total at 4% each (except for PS0, worth 2%)
Professionalism Penalty    0--100%  Excessive missed classes, rude behavior toward instructor or classmates, unauthorized homework assistance, contacting TAs when they are not on the clock, etc., can be held against a student when final grades are calculated.

The exact weights of assignments is subject to change as we further refine the assignments we will give.

Your final letter grade will then be assigned as follows:

You get  if you score  GPA value
-------- ------------- ---------
A+       near the top  4.0
A        ≥ 93%         4.0
A−       ≥ 90%         3.7
B+       ≥ 86%         3.3
B        ≥ 83%         3.0
B−       ≥ 80%         2.7
C+       ≥ 76%         2.3
C        ≥ 73%         2.0
C−       ≥ 70%         1.7
D+       ≥ 66%         1.3
D        ≥ 63%         1.0
D−       ≥ 60%         0.7
F        otherwise     0.0

**Rounding:** By default, grades will not be rounded in this course.

This numerical calculation is to be considered a **guideline** on your score in the course. Final letter grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials. I expect that qualitative adjustments will only result in a student's grade increasing (though in extreme circumstances I reserve the right to decrease grades).


## Absences and Deadlines

We will make allowances for cases where a student is not able to make
a scheduled cohort meeting or writeup deadline. We consider medical issues, personal trauma, legal
obligations, family responsibilities, and other justifiable conflicts
to be valid excuses.

We encourage cohorts meet for preparation meetings on schedule even in the case that one or more members must be absent. In the case that a student is unable to effectively contribute to a given problem set for excusable reasons, that student may submit an exemption request for that problem set (though that student will still be responsible for the relevent material).

In the case you are unable to submit a problem set/quiz on time, please submit an extension request. When possible, requests should be submitted 48 hours before the assessed cohort meeting.

In cases where a student must be exempted for more than one problem set during the semester, we will provide an alternate assessment through an individual video meeting.

## Bonus Points

We hope students will go beyond the provided
assignments and do other things to contribute to the class as well as
beyond. We provide some concrete opportunities for this in the form of
_Challenge Problems_, but also will award bonus points for relevant
and creative activities that students invent on their own. We also
offer bounty bonuses for contributions to the course textbook: having
a Pull Request accepted by the author is worth something (even if it
is just a simple typo fix) is worth one or more bonus individual grade points, and becoming the [#2 contributor (by "Additions")
to the book
repository](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/graphs/contributors?from=2017-07-23&to=2020-08-08&type=a)
is worth an automatic A in the class.


# Course Conduct

## Pledge

All students of CS3102 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning, and therefore egregiously unprofessional behavior could incur arbitrary penalty to your grade.

## Collaboration

We believe strongly in the value of a community of trust, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strengthening and
enhancing that community.

The course will be better for everyone if everyone can assume everyone
else is trustworthy. The course staff starts with the assumption that
all students at the university deserve to be trusted. 

To get the most out of this course, we expect all students to abide by the following:

- **Try it yourself first**: We believe it is important for students to
learn by thinking about problems on their own, so it is expected that
each student studies the provided materials and attempts to solve all
problems on their own before discussing the problems with others (including cohortmates
at the cohort meeting and course staff during office hours).
- **Discuss with other students in the course**: You are welcome to also discuss problem sets with any students currently enrolled in the class (including students who are and are not in your cohort) and to share what you
learn from them with your cohortmates. Do not discuss problems with 
any students who are not officially associated with the course (e.g. former CS3102 students or students attending other universities). Inter-cohort collaboration must be limited to discussion only, and may not involve any sharing of text, figures, illustrations, etc. that are submitted for grading.
- **Don't copy solutions**: Many problems in this course will be selected from problems used in
previous courses, as well as well-known problems. The goal of these
problems is to lead students to develop understanding of the
underlying concepts by working through the problems themselves and in
discussions with others, and this goal would be defeated if you
instead use posted solutions to the problems or else copied or heavily-sampled solutions composed by other cohorts. Other than
using solutions to the specific problems you are given, students are
encouraged to use any other resources they find helpful. Cohorts must draft solutions independently from other cohorts and may not share any text, figures, illustrations, etc. that are submitted for grading.
- **Complete Quizzes independently**: You may not collaborate with your cohort members while working on quizzes. You're welcome to reference or copy content from the textbook, officially-provided course materials, and notes compiled prior to your viewing the quiz. You may not consult the internet or communicate with your cohort members regarding quiz between when you first view the quiz and the quiz deadline.
- **Read the policy on each assignment**: A collaboration policy will be described on each assignment
  document, and may be different for different assignments. We aim to make the language describing the policy as clear
  and unambiguous as possible, but if anything is ever unclear about
  the stated policy for an assignment, please clarify with the course
  staff.




### Consequences of Dishonesty

If I believe you have acted dishonestly, I will communicate this fact to you and propose a penalty.
If you have information I lack, please share that with me; I may thereafter change my belief and/or proposed penalty. Please note that violating the collaboration guidelines above constitutes dishonest behavior.

## Cohort Conduct

Cohorts are an official course structure with their own expectations and policies designed to maximize the learning potential of cohorts. Students who participate in a cohort are expected to keep accountable to both their cohort-mates as well as the course staff. In particular, cohorts and the students in them must abide by the following:

1. **Establish a regular weekly meeting time.** Cohorts are expected to meet weekly, and to facilitate this expectation there should be a standing weekly meeting time throughout the semester. All cohort members are expected to attend this weekly meeting time unless exceptional circumstances prevent this. If a student *must* be absent from their cohort meeting that student must notify their cohort as soon as they can attempt to make alternative accommodations.
1. **Inform the course staff of non-participation.** Unless the course staff is informed otherwise, all problem set submissions made by any cohort member are assumed to represent all cohort members. Students may not receive credit for work that they did not do, so if a student is unable to contribute to a weekly problem set then a member of the course staff must be made aware of that. If you will not be able to contribute to a problem set, then let the course staff (and your cohort) know. If your cohort-mate has not contributed to a problem set, let the course staff know.  Upon being made aware of the circumstance, the course staff will decide whether to excuse the student from the assignment, make alternative submission arrangements, or take some other action. Whenever possible, the course staff should receive notice prior to the problem set deadline.
1. **Get pre-approval before changing cohort membership.** To better faciliate the goal of cohorts as effective learning sub-communities, membership in cohorts is expected to persist for the duration of the semester. In the case that changes to cohort membership are necessary or desired, the course instructor must approve of that change. As an additional motivation, there are logistics structure in place that must be updated with each change in cohort membership.


# Personal Accommodations

## Special Circumstances

The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center
(SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting [their website](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class**.

## Religious Observances

 It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely
held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing to
Prof. Brunelle as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about
academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs,contact the [University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)](https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu
or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of
the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

## Safe Environment

The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning
environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University
hold as critically important:

1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can
be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.
As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand
ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, I am responsible employee,
which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the
University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student
receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to
determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University
community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are [Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible
situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able
to help.

## Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
