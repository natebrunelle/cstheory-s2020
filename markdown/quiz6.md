title: Quiz 6 | Not Yet Available.
...

Currently, the deadline for this quiz (and all quiz re-takes) is set to 11:59pm on Friday May 6. This does not mean that you must submit this quiz in advance of that deadline. Instead, you may request any new deadline you would like between now and 5pm on May 13 (this is the end time of the university's official final exam time for the course, so by policy I cannot allow you to submit any later than that).

Be advised that once your deadline has passed and you have submitted something, you will not be able to select a new deadline for that quiz. You will be able to request a new quiz deadline for any quiz you have not yet submitted (regardless of whether the deadline has already passed). Prof. Brunelle will be processing extensions each morning, so if you submit in the afternoon then you may not see the deadline change that day. You can assume any extension requested for a deadline before 5pm on May 13 will be granted.
