This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 2](/week2.html) and [week 3](/week3.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 1 and 2. No material introduced after week 3 or first covered by problem set 3 will be represented in this quiz.

To help you prepare, I have provided sample solutions for [Problem Set 1](/files/ps/ps1_solutions.pdf) and [Problem Set 2](/files/ps/ps2_solutions.pdf).
