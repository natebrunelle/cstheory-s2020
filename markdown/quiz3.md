title: Quiz 3 | Complexity and Automata
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to demonstrate whether a function is in big-oh, big-omega, or big-theta of another.
1. One asking you to discuss the circuit complexity classes of a function
1. One asking you to give a regular expression and finite state automaton for some languages.

This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 6](/week6.html) and [week 7](/week7.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 5 and 6. No material introduced after week 7 will be represented in this quiz.

To help you prepare, I have will provide sample solutions for Problem Set 5 and Problem Set 6 on the morning of March 23 (after the deadlines for said problem sets have passed).
