title: Quiz 3 | Complexity and Automata
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to demonstrate whether a function is in big-oh, big-omega, or big-theta of another.
1. One asking you to discuss the circuit complexity classes of a function
1. One asking you to give a regular expression and finite state automaton for some languages.

This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 6](/week6.html) and [week 7](/week7.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 5 and 6. No material introduced after week 7 will be represented in this quiz.

To help you prepare, I have will provide sample solutions for Problem Set 5 and Problem Set 6 on the morning of March 23 (after the deadlines for said problem sets have passed).

1. Look in `quiz3.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with  your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`).
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `quiz3.pdf`.
