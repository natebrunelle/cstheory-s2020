title: Quiz 5 | Uncomputability
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz contains 2 questions:

1. One requiring you to apply Rice's theorem (or else say that it cannot be applied)
1. One requiring you to show a problem in uncomputable via proof by reduction.

This material is sourced from the material covered in [week 10](/week10.html) and [week 11](/week11.html). Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 9 and 10. No material introduced after week 11 will be represented in this quiz.

To help you prepare, I have provided sample solutions for [Problem Set 9](/files/ps/ps9_solutions.pdf) and [Problem Set 10](/files/ps/ps10_solutions.pdf)
